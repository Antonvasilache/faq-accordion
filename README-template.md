## My process

1. Creating the static webpage and styling it completely as in the design.For the layout I've used CSS Flexbox.
2. Adding the Javascript functionality for clicking the accordion items.
3. Making only one accordion item stay open.
4. Adding the keyboard navigation.
5. Styling the page for mobile screens.
6. Fixing navigation bugs.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- Building an accordion component with Javascript.
- Adding functionality for keyboard navigation.
- Managing the default behaviours of some events.

### Continued development
